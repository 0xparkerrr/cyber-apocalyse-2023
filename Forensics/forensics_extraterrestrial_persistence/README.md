There is a rumor that aliens have developed a persistence mechanism that is impossible to detect. After investigating her recently compromised Linux server, Pandora found a possible sample of this mechanism. Can you analyze it and find out how they install their persistence?

We can use a text editor to view how the script works.

There is an encoded base64 string in the script:
W1VuaXRdCkRlc2NyaXB0aW9uPUhUQnt0aDNzM180bDEzblNfNHIzX3MwMDAwMF9iNHMxY30KQWZ0ZXI9bmV0d29yay50YXJnZXQgbmV0d29yay1vbmxpbmUudGFyZ2V0CgpbU2VydmljZV0KVHlwZT1vbmVzaG90ClJlbWFpbkFmdGVyRXhpdD15ZXMKCkV4ZWNTdGFydD0vdXNyL2xvY2FsL2Jpbi9zZXJ2aWNlCkV4ZWNTdG9wPS91c3IvbG9jYWwvYmluL3NlcnZpY2UKCltJbnN0YWxsXQpXYW50ZWRCeT1tdWx0aS11c2VyLnRhcmdldA==

The decoded string gives us a description of the unit with the flag:
 - HTB{th3s3_4l13nS_4r3_s00000_b4s1c}
